Task app

This is an app made for a team to keep up with their tasks and deadlines.
To register in this app someone who has already registered has to add you to the user list,
that way no other people can reach the information.
In this page you can:
-add, edit and delete tasks
-upload, edit and delete files
-get email reminders three days before the deadline of a task

It also has a 'reset password' function in case a user forgets it.

Now an example email "pv@z" has been added to the user list, so that the app could be tested.
